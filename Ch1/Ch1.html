      <h2>Essential JavaScript best practices: Explain the pros and cons of:</h2>
      <ol type="1">
          <li>inline vs. embedded vs. external JavaScript using examples.
            <p>Inline Pros:  potentially reduces loading time, and "round trips." </p>
            <p>External Pros: Placing scripts in external files has some advantages: It separates HTML and code. It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain. Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads.</p>
            <p>Inline Cons:  potentially increases download times for the page, increases the HTML file size, and potentially makes coding more confusing as two languages are in one file.</p>
            <p>External Cons:The browser has to make an extra http request to get the js code. Code can be downloaded using the url of the js file. This can help coders to steal your code easily. </p>
            <p>Code Example: for inline use the <code class="html">&lt;script&gt&lt;/script/&gt</code> tags. For External use the <code class="html">src</code> tag to point to the JavaScript file.</p>
          </li>
          <li>indenting your code.
            <p>Pro: It will be easier for you and anyone else to read the code, trace elements, and find potential errors if you know how to indent code.</p>
            <p>Con: There are none.</p>
            <p>Code Example: Here is an example of the paragraph element being indented inside the list element.</p>
                <p><code class="html">&lt;li&gt;</code></p>
                <p><code class="html">&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;p&gt;</code></p>
                <p><code class="html">&lt;li&gt;</code></p>
              
            
          </li>
          <li>inserting code comments.
            <p>Pro: It makes the code easier to understand/read. It increases the chances that the documentation will be kept up to date with changes in the code. </p>
            <p>Con: Overcommenting can actually make the code more difficult to read, so be smart with your commenting.</p>
            <p>Code Example: <code class="html">//</code> This would be a comment in JavaScript.</p>
          </li>

      <!--Dotted list for Java vs JavaScript-->
      <hr>
      <h2>Java vs. JavaScript: Explain:</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>What is the general purpose for each language?</li>
          <li> Java: Java is one of the most popular programming languages used to create Web applications and platforms. It was designed for flexibility, allowing developers to write code that would run on any machine, regardless of architecture or platform.
            JavaScript: JavaScript is an object orient programming language designed to make web development easier and more attractive. In most cases, JavaScript is used to create responsive, interactive elements for web pages, enhancing the user experience.
          </li>
          <li>Strict vs. loose variable typing - what does this mean as it relates to Java and JavaScript?</li>
          <li>Strict: Java is a strongly typed programming language because every variable must be declared with a data type. A variable cannot start off life without knowing the range of values it can hold, and once it is declared, the data type of the variable cannot change.
            Loose: JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don't have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. JavaScript automatically types a variable based on what kind of information you assign to it (e.g., that '' or " " to indicate string values)
          </li>
          <li>Where is the source code for each language compiled or interpreted?</li>
          <li>Java:Java source code is compiled down to bytecode by the Java compiler. The bytecode is executed by a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Modern JVMs use a technique called Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation to compile the bytecode to native instructions understood by hardware CPU on the fly at runtime.
            JavaScript:An interpreter in the browser reads over the JavaScript code, interprets each line, and runs it. 
          </li>
